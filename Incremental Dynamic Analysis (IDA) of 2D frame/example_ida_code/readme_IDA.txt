This folder contains example calculations to demonstrate the use of fragility fitting functions for use with Incremental Dynamic Analysis Data. These calculations are based on the following paper:

Baker, J. W. (2013). “Efficient analytical fragility function fitting using dynamic structural analysis.” Earthquake Spectra, (in review).

The following files are included in this folder:

illustrate_ida_fits.m   -- the main script to run the demonstration analyses
fn_mle_truncated_ida.m  -- a function that performs fitting to truncated IDA data
fn_mle_pc.m				-- a function that performs fitting to MSA data (provided for comparison calculations)
